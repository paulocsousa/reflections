What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

	When I initialize a new repository the git system creates a folder 
	named .git with metadata of this repository to track that directory.
	I need to do it to make git track that repository.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?

	The staging area is the intermediate between the working directory
	and the repository, it bridge them, connects them, make the connection
	from the working directory and the repository, it acts as a middle area.
	Like its name is a staging area, where we can add files before making
	a commit to the repository. The value it offers are, it helps make
	commits more meaningful, we can think what files we want to add to that
	commit and if we want to go back and remove a file from that "commit"
	we remove it from the staging area. So it's useful and if we make a mistake
	we can go back, and when we were sure we can commit. It's a middle point
	where we can make a reflection.

change?
