When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
  It's useful to use a remote repository when I need or when a project need or have
  more than one contributor, the remote repository would be a central repository
  where all contributors can push or pull commits and contribute to the project in
  one single place where all files will be placed and updated.
  A remote repository can be useful too for backup, making a copy of a local 
  repository in a remote place.
  

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
  Because I might be working with a file that was updated with new code by another developer and if git automatically pull
  that changes to my local repository it might have conflicts.
  
  
Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
  A fork works in GitHub context, it's like a clone of a repository but it keeps a link to the
  original repository. A Clone is like it says it's a clone of a repository. And finally a branches
  operates on repositories, I can create a branch at a specific time in commits and go in a different
  way. A branch is a ramification of the master or the main branch at that point or state, where I
  can have or test different code. I would use forks when I want to clone a repository in GitHub, or
  keep a connection to the original repository, a clone when I want to clone a local repository or
  a remote repository, and a branch when I want to create a ramitication of the main branch at a
  determined time in repository history to have or test a different version of the code.
