When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
  It's useful to use a remote repository when I need or when a project need or have
  more than one contributor, the remote repository would be a central repository
  where all contributors can push or pull commits and contribute to the project in
  one single place where all files will be placed and updated.
  A remote repository can be useful too for backup, making a copy of a local 
  repository in a remote place.
